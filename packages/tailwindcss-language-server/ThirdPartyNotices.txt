@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio@0.4.2

# @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio

A plugin that provides a composable API for giving elements a fixed aspect ratio.


## Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

```sh
npm install -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file, and disable the `aspectRatio` core plugin to avoid conflicts with the native `aspect-ratio` utilities included in Tailwind CSS v3.0:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  corePlugins: {
    aspectRatio: false,
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Usage

Combine the `aspect-w-{n}` and `aspect-h-{n}` classes to specify the aspect ratio for an element:

```html
<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

Use `aspect-none` to remove any aspect ratio behavior:

```html
<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 lg:aspect-none">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

When removing aspect ratio behavior, if nested elements have `w-{n}` or `h-{n}` classes, ensure they are re-declared with a matching breakpoint prefix:

```html
<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 lg:aspect-none">
  <img src="..." alt="..." class="w-full h-full object-center object-cover lg:w-full lg:h-full" />
</div>
```

Note that due to the way this currently needs to be implemented ([the old padding-bottom trick](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/)) you need to assign the aspect ratio to a _parent_ element, and make the actual element you are trying to size the only child of that parent.

Once the [`aspect-ratio` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) is supported in modern browsers, we'll add official support to Tailwind CSS itself and deprecate this plugin.

Aspect ratio classes up to 16 are generated by default:

| Width | Height |
| --- | --- |
| `aspect-w-1` | `aspect-h-1` |
| `aspect-w-2` | `aspect-h-2` |
| `aspect-w-3` | `aspect-h-3` |
| `aspect-w-4` | `aspect-h-4` |
| `aspect-w-5` | `aspect-h-5` |
| `aspect-w-6` | `aspect-h-6` |
| `aspect-w-7` | `aspect-h-7` |
| `aspect-w-8` | `aspect-h-8` |
| `aspect-w-9` | `aspect-h-9` |
| `aspect-w-10` | `aspect-h-10` |
| `aspect-w-11` | `aspect-h-11` |
| `aspect-w-12` | `aspect-h-12` |
| `aspect-w-13` | `aspect-h-13` |
| `aspect-w-14` | `aspect-h-14` |
| `aspect-w-15` | `aspect-h-15` |
| `aspect-w-16` | `aspect-h-16` |

## Configuration

You can configure which values and variants are generated by this plugin under the `aspectRatio` key in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    aspectRatio: {
      1: '1',
      2: '2',
      3: '3',
      4: '4',
    }
  },
  variants: {
    aspectRatio: ['responsive', 'hover']
  }
}
```

## Compatibility with default aspect-ratio utilities

Tailwind CSS v3.0 shipped with [native aspect-ratio](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) support, and while these new utilities are great, the `aspect-ratio` property isn't supported in Safari 14, which still has [significant global usage](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio). If you need to support Safari 14, this plugin is still the best way to do that.

While it's technically possible to use the new native `aspect-ratio` utilities as well as this plugin in the same project, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to do so. If you're able to use the new native aspect-ratio utilities, just use them instead of this plugin, as they are a lot simpler and work much better.

However, if you do want to use both approaches in your project, maybe as a way of transitioning slowly from the plugin approach to the new native utilities, you'll need to add the following values to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    aspectRatio: {
      auto: 'auto',
      square: '1 / 1',
      video: '16 / 9',
      1: '1',
      2: '2',
      3: '3',
      4: '4',
      5: '5',
      6: '6',
      7: '7',
      8: '8',
      9: '9',
      10: '10',
      11: '11',
      12: '12',
      13: '13',
      14: '14',
      15: '15',
      16: '16',
    },
  },
}
```

This is necessary, as the default `aspectRatio` values are overwritten by this plugin's values.

@tailwindcss/container-queries@0.1.0

# @tailwindcss/container-queries

A plugin for Tailwind CSS v3.2+ that provides utilities for container queries.

## Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

```sh
npm install @tailwindcss/container-queries
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/container-queries'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Usage

```html
<!-- Container queries without a specific container name -->
<div class="@container">
  <!-- Container query with a size of `lg` defined in your tailwind.config.js file -->
  <div class="@lg:underline"></div>
  <div class="@[1024px]:underline"></div>
</div>

<!-- Container queries that apply for a defined container name -->
<div class="@container/sidebar">
  <div class="@lg/sidebar:underline"></div>
  <div class="@[1024px]/sidebar:underline"></div>
</div>
```

### Container types

| Class                       | css                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@container`                | `container-type: inline-size;`                          |
| `@container/sidebar`        | `container-type: inline-size; container-name: sidebar;` |
| `@container-normal`         | `container-type: normal;`                               |
| `@container-normal/sidebar` | `container-type: inline-size; container-name: sidebar;` |

## Configuration

By default we ship with the following configured values:

| Name  | Value   |
| ----- | ------- |
| `xs`  | `20rem` |
| `sm`  | `24rem` |
| `md`  | `28rem` |
| `lg`  | `32rem` |
| `xl`  | `36rem` |
| `2xl` | `42rem` |
| `3xl` | `48rem` |
| `4xl` | `56rem` |
| `5xl` | `64rem` |
| `6xl` | `72rem` |
| `7xl` | `80rem` |

You can configure which values are available for this plugin under the `containers` key in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      containers: {
        xs: '20rem',
        sm: '24rem',
        md: '28rem',
        lg: '32rem',
        xl: '36rem',
        // etc...
      },
    },
  },
}
```

debounce@1.2.0

# debounce

  Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after a repeated
  action has completed.

## Installation

    $ component install component/debounce

  Or in node:

    $ npm install debounce

## Example

```js
var debounce = require('debounce');
window.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);

function resize(e) {
  console.log('height', window.innerHeight);
  console.log('width', window.innerWidth);
}
```

To later clear the timer and cancel currently scheduled executions:
```
window.onresize.clear();
```

To execute any pending invocations and reset the timer:
```
window.onresize.flush();
```

Alternately, if using newer syntax:

```js
import { debounce } from "debounce";
```

## API

### debounce(fn, wait, [ immediate || false ])

  Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function that
  will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed
  since the last time it was invoked.

  Pass `true` for the `immediate` parameter to cause debounce to trigger
  the function on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge of the wait
  interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks
  on a "submit" button from firing a second time.

  The debounced function returned has a property 'clear' that is a 
  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.

  The debounced function returned has a property 'flush' that is a 
  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,
  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced
  function.

dlv@1.1.3

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
```


### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.
